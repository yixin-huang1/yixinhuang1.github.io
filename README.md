# About me
## Welcome to Yixin’s page!

* I am a fourth year undergrad studying CS and Applied Math. Additionally, I am a research assistant at UC Berkeley SkyLab, working with Prof. Joey Gonzalez.

* My research focuses on building scalable data generation pipeline. I have built a synthetic data generation pipeline for Openfunctions-v3 and did data cleaning for BFCL-v3 for Gorilla LLM. Currently, I’m currently working on Chatbot Arena project, a crowdsourced AI evaluation platform at LMSYS.org.
