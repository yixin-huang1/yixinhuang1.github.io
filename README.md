# Yixin Huang

I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Applied Mathematics (May 2025, GPA: 3.9). As an AI/ML Engineer and Researcher, I am passionate about advancing the field of AI, particularly in LLM evaluation, and driven to create technology that understands and enhances human experiences.

## Experience

During my studies at UC Berkeley, I had the privilege of working as a **Research Assistant at the Sky Computing Lab**, advised by Prof. Joey Gonzalez and Prof. Ion Stoica. In this role, I engineered a scalable data pipeline for Openfunctions-v3, led data cleaning efforts for the BFCL-v3 leaderboard (which received recognition from organizations like Meta, Salesforce, and Alibaba), and contributed to enhancing LLM evaluation methodologies using LLM-as-a-Judge for Arena-Hard-v2.

I also contributed to the **Chatbot Arena Project at LMSYS.org**, focusing on crowdsourced AI evaluation, further deepening my expertise in practical LLM assessment.

## Interests

My primary interests lie in the fundamental challenges of training large-scale models, improving the capabilities and reliability of AI systems, and exploring the frontiers of LLM evaluation. I am dedicated to developing technology that not only performs effectively but also aligns with human values and experiences.
